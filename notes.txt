If you want an element that only takes up its allocated width, like a button, use flex: none that expands to 0 0 auto.

If you want to explicitly size an element, use flex: 0 0 size. For example: flex 0 0 60px.

If you want an element that expands to fill space available, that is sharing space equally if there are multiple elements of
 this kind within the flow, use flex: auto. It expands to 1 1 auto.
